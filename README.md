# FIRST-Deep-Space
Team LongMetal 7127's robot code for the FIRST 2019 Deep Space challenge.

## Conventions
* <span style="color:green">**DO**</span> write *descriptive* comments for things that are *not obvious* (eg. obscure methods)

*Related*:
* <span style="color:green">**DO**</span> name your variables and objects descriptively/uniquely
* <span style="color:yellow">**AVOID**</span> using single letter variable names as much as you can (you <span style="color:green">**MAY**</span> for simple counters/loops as long as their scope isn't too big)
